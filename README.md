FoodHub Data Analysis

This project explores customer order data from FoodHub, focusing on delivery performance, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, I conducted an end-to-end data analysis workflow that demonstrates both data science and business analysis skills.

Objectives

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on FoodHub order data.

Identify key drivers of customer satisfaction (e.g., delivery time, ratings).

Analyze order trends across customers, delivery partners, and cuisine types.

Generate actionable business insights to improve FoodHubâ€™s operations and marketing strategy.

Tools & Skills

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

Business Analysis: KPI definition, cost-benefit interpretation, actionable recommendations

Data Cleaning & Wrangling: Handling missing values, feature engineering

Key Insights (Sample)

Delivery time is the strongest factor influencing customer ratings.

Returning customers tend to place larger orders, contributing significantly to revenue.

Certain cuisine categories have high demand but lower satisfaction, highlighting opportunities for improvement.
